/* 
 * 🛡️ FORCE ANIMATIONS DISABLED
 * 
 * This file previously contained aggressive !important rules that forced generic animations.
 * This was "blocking" complex custom animations (like the modern multi-ring spinners) 
 * by overriding their specific keyframes.
 * 
 * Now that the underlying "animation: none" bugs are fixed in the component CSS files,
 * we can safely disable this aggressive override file to let the beautiful custom 
 * animations shine through! ✨
